## Disabling Antivirus (Needed!)
Some antivirus programs may flag the **Fixer.bat** file as potentially harmful because it is not a well-known application. This is a common behavior for antivirus programs when encountering files that are not digitally signed or not from well-known sources (this is not a virus!).

If you trust the source and are sure the file is safe, you may need to temporarily disable your antivirus software to allow the tool to run.

### How to Disable Antivirus:
1. **Windows Defender**:
   - Open the **Windows Security** settings.
   - Go to **Virus & Threat Protection**.
   - Click on **Manage Settings** under **Virus & Threat Protection Settings**.
   - Toggle off **Real-time Protection**.
   
2. **Other Antivirus Programs**:
   - Open the antivirus program you are using (e.g., Norton, McAfee, etc.).
   - Look for an option that says **Disable**, **Turn Off**, or **Pause Protection**.
   - Temporarily disable real-time protection, and remember to re-enable it once you have finished using the tool.

> **Note**: Make sure to re-enable your antivirus after running the tool to ensure your system remains protected. Disabling your antivirus can expose your system to potential risks, so proceed with caution.

### Why Disable Antivirus?
Some antivirus programs may incorrectly flag the **Fixer.bat** file as a threat because it is not from a well-known or recognized publisher. This is a false positive and is common with small or custom software tools. Disabling antivirus temporarily allows the **Fixer.bat** to run, but only do this if you trust the source.

However, always exercise caution when running software that modifies system settings or interacts with other applications, especially if it's from an unknown source.

## Troubleshooting
- **The Fixer didn't work?** Try running the tool as an administrator by right-clicking the `.bat` file and selecting "Run as Administrator".
- **Executor still not working?** Ensure that your system meets the requirements and that no antivirus is blocking the executable. Follow the steps above to temporarily disable antivirus and try again.
